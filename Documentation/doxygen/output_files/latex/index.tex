This project is a personal endeavor focused on developing reusable firmware for microcontroller platforms. The goal is to create a modular and efficient SPI reusable driver that can be easily adapted to various microcontrollers. The project communicates two boars (Master-\/\+Slave) between them. The DIO driver is used to configure the selected SPI port.\hypertarget{index_version}{}\doxysection{Version Log}\label{index_version}

The software architecture follows a layered approach. This design pattern separates low-\/level code (drivers or HALs), and application-\/specific code. A layered architecture promotes reusability and simplifies the portability between different applications or microcontrollers. The layered architecture can be seen in figure 1 and contains a driver and application layer operating on the hardware.

The driver layer includes all the code (drivers) necessary to get the microcontroller and any other associated board hardware, such as sensors (accelerometer), buttons, and so forth, running. The application code (main) contains no driver code but has access to the low-\/level hardware through a driver-\/layer interface that hides the hardware details from the application developer but still allows them to perform a useful function.\hypertarget{index_coding-standards}{}\doxysection{Coding Standards}\label{index_coding-standards}
This project is developed as bare-\/metal firmware and adheres to industry-\/standard coding practices, following the MISRA-\/C guidelines. This includes consistent naming conventions, code formatting, and best practices for code organization and documentation.\hypertarget{index_description}{}\doxysection{Project Description}\label{index_description}
In this setup, the SPI1 is configured as a master. The setting includes a baud rate = 4KHz, full duplex communication, an 8-\/bit data frame format, and most significant bit transmission. The SPI driver is used to configure the ADXL345 accelerometer. A KY-\/57 logic analyzer is connected between the MCU and the ADXL345 accelerometer for data reception and analysis. To establish the physical connections, the GPIO driver configures the SPI1 pins. The following table illustrates the pin connections among the Nucleo board, and KY-\/57 logic analyzer\+:

The ADXL345\+\_\+init function configures the ADXL345 accelerometer with 10 bits full resolution at +/-\/4g and sets the device into measurement mode. The application code retrieves data from the accelerometer\textquotesingle{}s x, and y axes, subsequently processing this data to obtain the g-\/scale factor.\hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\doxysection{Project Requirements}\label{index_requirements}
